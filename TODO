BUGS

FUNCTIONALITY
    * provide clickable list of functions; compose using mouse
    * draggable integers in function input; listen realtime changes
    * export sound
    -> check out "log(sin(x^sin(x)))* (sqrt(x))*72*((1/6^2)*sin(880 * 2 * pi * x)+(1/6^5)*sin(220 * 2 * pi * x)+(1/6^4)*sin(440 * 2 * pi * x)+(1/6^3)*sin(110 * 2 * pi * x)+(1/6^2)*sin(55 * 2 * pi * x)+(1/6)*sin(27.5 * 2 * pi * x))^(3/2)"

LAYOUT

UX
    * onclick of signals in sidebar should give focus
    * improve zoom algo (stepping, easing)
    * listen realtime change when dragging selection window?

DESIGN
    * Georgia is not perfect (ex. too big parens)
    * color each entry of sidebar to color of signal
    * structure sidebar entries of signals

IDEAS
    * mirror sample area around an x value (highest x value of selection)

STRUCTURE
    * SIGNAL is a model
    * GRAPH is a view for SIGNAL
    * AUDIO is a view for SIGNAL
    * APP is a controller
    * SIDEBAR is a view and model (replace with a collection of signals? and just a view)
