BUGS
    * sometimes sounds stay in the system, make sure to always turn them off
    (removed by silencing when changing signals; perhaps not ideal)
    * pressing space -> jumps down page (fix: max-height: 100vh; on sidebar?)

FUNCTIONALITY
    * REFACTOR
    * onscroll for zoom (improve algo!)
    -> shouldn't be able to zoom into negative

LAYOUT
    *? center shit

UX
    * onclick of signals in sidebar should give focus
    *? onclick of canvas to select nearest signal
    *? drag signal to increase amplitude and dephase
    * place x origin (dblclick? mousedown + space?)
    * fit sample window (mousedown + dragging + space)
        -> bring outernmost point of selection window to edge
        -> better zoom algo

DESIGN
    * Georgia is not perfect (ex. too big parens)
    * color each entry of sidebar to color of signal
    * structure sidebar entries of signals
    * expanding input box (max-width, expand)

SOUND
    * "smartboxing" of user selected sample area, to fit better to signal

IDEAS
    * mirror sample area around an x value (highest x value)
