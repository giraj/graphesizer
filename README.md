GRAPHESIZER
==============
*see and listen to mathematical functions*

Interesting parts:
-------------------
* static/js/canvas.js:  logic for drawing graphs
* sound.py:  logic for creating sounds

Thanks to someone for convert-math-to-js.js and normalize.css

Currently doesn't work in Firefox due to html5 input type="range" magic.
